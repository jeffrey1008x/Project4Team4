The topic that was chosen for the project was housing prices. Over the last few years we were able to observe a surge in the housing market. This is why we decided to analyze it and try to predict it.

The repository contains the following :

Linear regression:
- house_price_linear_regression_colab.ipynb
  
Neuro network:
- Project_4 Neuro netowork Attempt1.ipynb
- Project_4 Neuro netowork Attempt2.ipynb
- .gitignore
  
Powerpoint:
- Housing Prices Final ppt
  
Graphs :
- matplotlib graphs.ipynb
- matplotlib updated.ipynb

CSV files:
- train_processed.xlsx
- train_processed_cleaned.xlsx

Note: Running notebook (.ipynb) files on Google Colab is strongly recommended  to avoid any dependence issue.   
Please also upload train_processed.xlsx to Colab if you do.
